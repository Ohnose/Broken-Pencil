# Broken Pencil

This web app is a remake of the popular board game "Telestrations".

This game is a combination between pictionary and broken telephone. In your group of friends, everyone will choose a word to draw in under 30 seconds. Immediately after, the drawings will be sent to the person to their "right" and using this image they will guess the word. This word would them get passed on creating this cycle until the the original drawing would have made a full circle. At the end, they will be able to see how all the different original drawings have changed over time with their friend's varying intepretations.
